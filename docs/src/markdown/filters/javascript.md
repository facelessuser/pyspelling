# JavaScript

## Usage

When first in the chain, the JavaScript filter uses no special encoding detection. It will assume `utf-8` if no encoding
BOM is found, and the user has not overridden the fallback encoding. Text is returned in chunks based on the context of
the text.  The filter can return JSDoc comments, block comment, inline comment, string, and template literal content.

```yaml
matrix:
- name: javascript
  pipeline:
  - pyspelling.filters.javascript:
      jsdocs: true
      line_comments: false
      block_comments: false
  sources:
  - js_files/**/*.js
```
