# Stylesheets

## Usage

The Stylesheets plugin is designed to find and return comments in CSS, SCSS, and SASS (CSS does not support inline
comments). When first in the chain, the filter uses no special encoding detection. It will assume `utf-8` if no encoding
BOM is found, and the user has not overridden the fallback encoding. Text is returned in chunks based on the context of
the text: block or inline.

You can specify `sass` or `scss` in the option `stylesheets` if you need to capture inline comments.

```yaml
matrix:
- name: scss
  pipeline:
  - pyspelling.filters.stylesheets:
      stylesheets: scss
  default_encoding: utf-8
  sources:
  - docs/src/scss/*.scss
  aspell:
    lang: en
    d: en_US
  dictionary:
    wordlists:
    - docs/src/dictionary/en-custom.txt
    output: build/dictionary/scss.dic
```

Stylesheets returns text with the following categories depending on what stylesheet mode is enabled. Categories prefixed
with `css` are for CSS etc.
