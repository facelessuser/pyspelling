It is essentially a wrapper around the command line utility of these two spell checking tools, and allows you to setup different spelling tasks for different file types. You can apply specific and different filters and options to each task. PySpelling can also be used in CI environments to fail the build if there are misspelled words.</p> <p>Aspell and Hunspell are very good spell checking tools. Aspell particularly comes with a couple of filters, but the filters are limited in types and aren't extremely flexible. PySpelling was created to work around Aspell's and Hunspell's filtering shortcomings by creating a wrapper around them that could be extended to handle more kinds of file formats and provide more advanced filtering. If you need to filter out specific HTML tags with specific IDs or class names, PySpelling can do it. If you want to scan Python files for docstrings, but also avoid specific content within the docstring, you can do that as well. If PySpelling doesn't have a filter you need, with access to so many available Python modules, you can easily write your own.</p> <pre><code>Computer:pyspelling facelessuser$ pyspelling\nMisspelled words:\n&lt;html-content&gt; site/index.html: P\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ncheking\nparticularlly\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMisspelled words:\n&lt;context&gt; pyspelling/__meta__.py(41): Pep440Version\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAccessors\naccessor\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n!!!Spelling check failed!!!\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"#prerequisites","title":"Prerequisites","text":"<p>PySpelling is a wrapper around either Aspell or Hunspell.

It should be noted that <code>pipeline</code> filters are processed before sending the buffer to Aspell or Hunspell. By default, we disable any special modes of the spell checkers.</p> <p>Spellcheckers like Aspell have builtin filtering. If all you need is the builtin filters from Aspell, the <code>pipeline</code> configuration can be omitted. For instance, to use Aspell's builtin Markdown mode, simply set the Aspell option directly and omit the pipeline.</p> <pre><code>- name: markdown\n  group: docs\n  sources:\n  - README.md\n  aspell:\n    lang: en\n    d: en_US\n    mode: markdown\n  dictionary:\n    wordlists:\n    - .spell-dict\n    output: build/dictionary/markdown.dic\n</code></pre> <p>You can also use PySpelling <code>pipeline</code> filters and enable special modes of the underlying spell checker if desired.</p> <p>PySpelling allows you to define tasks that outline what kind of files you want to spell check, and then sends them down a pipeline that filters the content returning chunks of text with some associated context. Each chunk is sent down each step of the pipeline until it reaches the final step, the spell check step. Between filter steps, you can also insert flow control steps that allow you to have certain text chunks skip specific steps. All of this is done with pipeline plugins.</p> <p>Let's say you had some Markdown files and wanted to convert them to HTML, and then filter out specific tags. You could just use the Markdown filter to convert the file to HTML and then pass it through the HTML filter to extract the text from the HTML tags.</p> <pre><code>matrix:\n- name: markdown\n  sources:\n  - README.md\n  pipeline:\n  - pyspelling.filters.markdown:\n  - pyspelling.filters.html:\n      comments: false\n      attributes:\n      - title\n      - alt\n      ignores:\n      - code\n      - pre\n</code></pre> <p>If needed, you can also insert flow control steps before certain filter steps. Each text chunk that is passed between filters has a category assigned to it from the previous filter. Flow control steps allow you to restrict the next filter to specific categories, or exclude specific categories from the next step. This is covered in more depth in Flow Control.</p> <p>If for some reason you need to send the file directly to the spell checker without using PySpelling's pipeline, simply set <code>pipeline</code> to <code>null</code>. This sends file directly to the spell checker without evaluating the encoding or passing through any filters. Specifically with Hunspell, it also sends the spell checker the filename instead of piping the content as Hunspell has certain features that don't work when piping the data, such as OpenOffice ODF input.</p> <p>Below is an example where we send an OpenOffice ODF file directly to Hunspell in order to use Hunspell's <code>-O</code> option to parse the ODF file. Keep in mind that when doing this, no encoding is sent to the spell checker unless you define <code>default_encoding</code>. If <code>default_encoding</code> is not defined, PySpelling will decode the returned content with the terminal's encoding (or what it thinks the terminal's encoding is).</p> <pre><code>matrix:\n- name: openoffice_ODF\n  sources:\n  - file.odt\n  hunspell:\n    d: en_US\n    O: true\n  pipeline: null\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"configuration/#languages","title":"Languages","text":"<p>Languages in both Aspell and Hunspell are controlled by the <code>-d</code> option.

There is usually one <code>.dat</code> file that covers a language and its variants. So <code>en_US</code> and <code>en_GB</code> will both build their wordlists against the <code>en.dat</code> file.</p> <p>Since spell checker options vary between both Aspell and Hunspell, spell checker specific options are handled by under special keys named <code>aspell</code> and <code>hunspell</code>. To learn more, check out Spell Checker Options.</p> <p>By default, PySpelling sets your main dictionary to <code>en</code> for Aspell and <code>en_US</code> for Hunspell. If you do not desire an American English dictionary, or these dictionaries are not installed in their expected default locations, you will need to configure PySpelling so it can find your preferred dictionary. Since dictionary configuring varies for each spell checker, the main dictionary (and virtually any spell checker specific option) is performed via Spell Checker Options.</p> <p>International Languages</p> <p>Some languages use special Unicode characters in them. The spell checker in use may be particular about how the Unicode characters are normalized. When PySpelling passes the content to be spellchecked you may want to normalize the Unicode content if it is having trouble. This can be done with the <code>Text</code> filter.</p> <p>For instance, here is how to do so via Aspell with a Czech dictionary.</p> <pre><code>matrix:\n- name: czechstuff\n  sources: *.txt\n  aspell:\n    lang: cs\n    d: cs\n  dictionary:\n    wordlist:\n    - .dictionary\n    output: build/czech.dict\n  pipeline:\n  - pyspelling.filters.text:\n      normalize: nfd\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"configuration/#dictionaries-and-personal-wordlists","title":"Dictionaries and Personal Wordlists","text":"<p>While provided dictionaries cover a number of commonly used words, you may need to specify additional words that are not covered in the default dictionaries.

It will assume <code>utf-8</code> if no encoding header is found, and the user has not overridden the fallback encoding.</p> <p>The HTML filter uses BeautifulSoup4 to convert the Unicode content to XML structure. Tag content is as one block for the whole file. If enabled, the XML filter will also return chunks for comments and even attributes. Each type of text chunk is returned with their own category type.</p> <p>Tags can be captured or ignored with the <code>captures</code> and <code>ignores</code> options. These options work by employing CSS selectors to target the tags. The CSS selectors are based on a limited subset of CSS4 selectors.</p> <pre><code>matrix:\n- name: xml\n  pipeline:\n  - pyspelling.filters.xml:\n      comments: false\n      attributes:\n      - some-data\n      ignores:\n      - :matches(ignore_tag, [ignore_attribute])\n  sources:\n  - site/*.xml\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"filters/xml/#supported-css-selectors","title":"Supported CSS Selectors","text":"<p>The CSS selectors are based on a limited subset of CSS4 selectors.

So after the Python step, which returns both docstrings and inline comments, we specify that we only want to allow <code>py-comment</code> categories in the next filter. The context filter removes the lines that start with the aforementioned things, and passes the text down the pipe.  The last filter step receives both the <code>context</code> text objects and the <code>py-docstrings</code> from earlier.</p> <pre><code>matrix:\n- name: python\n  sources:\n  - setup.py\n  - pyspelling/**/*.py\n  aspell:\n    lang: en\n  dictionary:\n    wordlists:\n    - docs/src/dictionary/en-custom.txt\n    output: build/dictionary/python.dic\n  pipeline:\n  - pyspelling.filters.python:\n  - pyspelling.flow_control.wildcard:\n      allow:\n      - py-comment\n  - pyspelling.filters.context:\n      context_visible_first: true\n      delimiters:\n      # Ignore lint (noqa) and coverage (pragma) as well as shebang (#!)\n      - open: '^(?: *(?:noqa\\b|pragma: no cover)|!)'\n        close: '$'\n      # Ignore Python encoding string -*- encoding stuff -*-\n      - open: '^ *-\\*-'\n        close: '-\\*-$'\n  - pyspelling.filters.context:\n      context_visible_first: true\n      escapes: \\\\[\\\\`~]\n      delimiters:\n      # Ignore multiline content between fences (fences can have 3 or more back ticks)\n      # ```\n      # content\n      # ```\n      - open: '(?s)^(?P&lt;open&gt; *`{3,})$'\n        close: '^(?P=open)$'\n      # Ignore text between inline back ticks\n      - open: '(?P&lt;open&gt;`+)'\n        close: '(?P=open)'\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"flow_control/wildcard/#options","title":"Options","text":"Options Type Default Description <code>allow</code> [string] <code>[\"*\"]</code> The chunk of text is allowed to be evaluated by the next filter. <code>skip</code> [string] <code>[]</code> The chunk of text should skip the next filter. <code>halt</code> [string] <code>[]</code> Halts the progress of the text chunk down the pipeline and sends it directly to the spell checker."}]}
